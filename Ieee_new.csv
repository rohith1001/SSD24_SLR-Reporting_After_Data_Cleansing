Although, Python was conceptualized in the late 1980s and after its implementation in 1989, it has emerged as a new multi-paradigm language platform with advent of Big Data. Python includes various data structures, standard libraries with the implementation of sentiment analysis and data science code. The real aim is to provide awareness to all the programmers about various facts of python language. It tells how Python works with various commercial and social communities and provides complete and desirable results. There are many areas and applications where Python makes its own stand as compared to other programming languages.","2019 International Conference on Machine Learning, Big Data, Cloud and Parallel Computing (COMITCon)",A Survey: How Python Pitches in IT-World,2019,Python;multiparadigm language platform;Big Data;data structures;sentiment analysis;data science code;programming paradigms;IT world;Python language;Python;Libraries;Sentiment analysis;Data structures;Machine learning;Programming;Python data structures;Python Applications;Python standard libraries.,10.1109/COMITCon.2019.8862251,,Feb,248.0,251.0,4.0

In 2008 its authors introduced a new version of the language, Python 3.0, that was not backward compatible with Python 2, initiating a transitional phase for Python software developers. Aims: The study described in this paper investigates the degree to which Python software developers are making the transition from Python 2 to Python 3. Method: We have developed a Python compliance analyser, PyComply, and have assembled a large corpus of Python applications. We use PyComply to measure and quantify the degree to which Python 3 features are being used, as well as the rate and context of their adoption. Results: In fact, Python software developers are not exploiting the new features and advantages of Python 3, but rather are choosing to retain backward compatibility with Python 2.

It provides a comprehensive library of device models and it allows users to define their own. Models for dynamic simulation can be defined in the DIgSILENT Simulation Language (DSL). When the functionality of DSL is insufficient, new DSL functions can be defined in C or C++. However, C and C++ can be challenging for inexperienced programmers. Furthermore, every time the C or C++ code is modified, it needs to be recompiled and PowerFactory needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect, which slows down the workflow, model development, and inhibits rapid prototyping. In this paper we present an open source library that allows users to call Python functions and methods from DSL with minimal effort. Python is a powerful and much easier to use language than C or C++. Additionally, Python programs do not need to be compiled. Furthermore, with this library PowerFactory does not need to be restarted every time the Python code is changed. To illustrate what can be accomplished with our library we present three example use cases related to load modeling, co-simulation, and fault detection based on machine learning. The examples show that it becomes straightforward to enhance DSL with Python and that sophisticated models can be produced with reduced effort using popular open source Python libraries. As a consequence, PowerFactory users gain access to enhanced modeling capabilities and user-friendliness, and a more speedy workflow, which is beneficial for rapid prototyping.",2019 IEEE 28th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE),Enhancing PowerFactory Dynamic Models with Python for Rapid Prototyping,2019,fault diagnosis;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;power system analysis computing;power system simulation;public domain software;Python;simulation languages;software libraries;device models;dynamic simulation;DIgSILENT Simulation Language;DSL functions;model development;rapid prototyping;open source library;Python functions;Python programs;Python code;load modeling;PowerFactory users;user-friendliness;PowerFactory dynamic models;DIgSILENT PowerFactory;PowerFactory;open source Python libraries;power system analysis tools;C;C++;DSL;Python;Libraries;Load modeling;C++ languages;Power system dynamics;Rapid prototyping;Co-simulation;DSL;dynamic simulation;machine-learning;PowerFactory;Python,10.1109/ISIE.2019.8781432,2163-5145,June,93.0,99.0,7.0

46,9098756,L Harrison,"This comprehensive resource provides readers with the tools necessary to perform analysis of various waveforms for use in radar systems. It provides information about how to produce synthetic aperture (SAR) images by giving a tomographic formulation and implementation for SAR imaging. Tracking filter fundamentals, and each parameter associated with the filter and how each affects tracking performance are also presented. Various radar cross section measurement techniques are covered, along with waveform selection analysis through the study of the ambiguity function for each particular waveform from simple linear frequency modulation (LFM) waveforms to more complicated coded waveforms. The text includes the Python tool suite, which allows the reader to analyze and predict radar performance for various scenarios and applications. Also provided are MATLAB® scripts corresponding to the Python tools. The software includes a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that provides visualizations of the concepts being covered. Users have full access to both the Python and MATLAB source code to modify for their application. With examples using the tool suite are given at the end of each chapter, this text gives readers a clear understanding of how important target scattering is in areas of target detection, target tracking, pulse integration, and target discrimination.",Introduction to Radar Using Python and MATLAB,Introduction to Radar Using Python and MATLAB,2019,,,,,,,
47,9054609,"S Sandha, M Aggarwal, I Fedorov, M Srivastava","Tuning hyperparameters for machine learning algorithms is a tedious task, one that is typically done manually. To enable automated hyperparameter tuning, recent works have started to use techniques based on Bayesian optimization. However, to practically enable automated tuning for large scale machine learning training pipelines, significant gaps remain in existing libraries, including lack of abstractions, fault tolerance, and flexibility to support scheduling on any distributed computing framework. To address these challenges, we present Mango, a Python library for parallel hyperparameter tuning. Mango enables the use of any distributed scheduling framework, implements intelligent parallel search strategies, and provides rich abstractions for defining complex hyperparameter search spaces that are compatible with scikit-learn. Mango is comparable in performance to Hyperopt [1], another widely used library. Mango is available open-source [2] and is currently used in production at Arm Research to provide state-of-art hyperparameter tuning capabilities.","ICASSP 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",Mango: A Python Library for Parallel Hyperparameter Tuning,2020,Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;parallel processing;Python;scheduling;search problems;software libraries;Mango;Python library;parallel hyperparameter tuning;automated hyperparameter tuning;machine learning;distributed computing;distributed scheduling;complex hyperparameter search spaces;scikit-learn;intelligent parallel search strategies;Bayesian optimization;Hyperparameter tuning;Bayesian optimization;Python library;Parallel Optimizer,10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9054609,2379-190X,May,3987.0,3991.0,5.0

In the agricultural sector, most of the devices and greenhouses still use very old serial communication technologies. Nowadays, many ICT technologies such as ZigBee, Bluetooth and the Internet are spreading but still not interoperable. A set of standards is under development in Korea to ensure interoperability between different vendors. In particular, core interoperability can be provided by standardizing the LCP protocol independent of the underlying network infrastructure. In this paper, we designed service control protocol based on LCP protocol and implemented it using Python.
