Recently, the Python language has taken over this role, mainly due to its huge standard library and the great number of third-party libraries available. Given that the development of equivalent libraries for Racket is an enormous task that cannot be currently done in an acceptable time frame, the next best option is to allow the Racket platform to use Python programs and libraries.We have been developing an implementation of Python for the Racket platform based on a source-to-source compiler. In order to provide good performance and good interoperability with the Racket platform, the runtime libraries are being implemented over Racket data-types. This, however, entails implementing all of Python's standard library on Racket and it does not provide access to popular Python libraries implemented using C module extensions (such as Numpy and SciPy).This paper presents an alternative approach that allows libraries from Python's reference implementation to be imported and used in our Racket implementation of Python, immediately providing access to all of Python's standard library and every third-party library, including NumPy and SciPy.The proposed solution involves importing Python module objects directly from Python's virtual machine, by calling the Python/C API through Racket's Foreign Function Interface, and converting them to objects usable by our Racket runtime libraries, making them compatible with the Racket platform.This compatibility layer therefore relies on relatively expensive foreign function calls to Python's libraries, but our performance tests show that the overhead introduced by them is quite low and, for most cases, it can be minimized in order to attain the same performance as Python's reference implementation.\"), \n",

We present a method of respiratory analysis that is non-contact, but also measures the exhaled air of a human subject directly through a medium-based exhale visualization technique. In this method, we place a thin medium perpendicular to the exhaled airflow of an individual, and use a thermal camera to record the heat signature from the exhaled breath on the opposite side of the material. Respiratory behaviors are extracted from the thermal data in real time using Python. Our prototype is an embedded, low-power device that performs image and signal processing in realtime with Python, making use of powerful existing Python modules for scientific computing and visualization. Our proposed respiration monitoring technique accurately reports breathing rate, and may provide other metrics not obtainable through other non-contact methods. This method can be useful for medical applications where long-term respiratory analysis is necessary, and for applications that require additional information about breathing behavior.\"), \n",

In earlier work we examined the impact of changing CS1 from C++ to Python while leaving CS2 in C++. We found that Python-prepared CS1 students fared no differently in CS2 than students whose CS1 course was in C++, even though CS2 was taught in C++ and covered the same topics as in previous years. Was that an anomaly? What happens in the next tier of courses? When our CS1 was first changed to Python there were many students who had taken CS1 in C++ still in the system. The result is that there is a cadre of students with either CS1 in Python or CS1 in C++ moving together through our curriculum. This one-time occurrence is an opportunity to study the students with many variables fixed. Our next tier of courses is a C-based computer organization course, a C++ based object-oriented software design course, and a data structures course. We found that the students who started with Python fared as well as the CS1 C++ students. As before, the best predictor of performance was their college GPA. Python versus C++ CS1 preparation was not a predictor of performance in any course. We conclude again that in our C++ based curriculum changing CS1 to Python had no negative impact on student performance and did not require any significant change in those subsequent courses.'), \n",

While to some extent this is to be expected from a dynamic language, it is not clear how much each dynamic feature contributes to the costs of interpreting Python. In this study we attempt to quantify the costs of language features such as dynamic typing, reference counting for memory management, boxing of numbers, and late binding of function calls.We use an experimental compilation framework for Python that can make use of type annotations provided by the user to specialize the program as well as elide unnecessary reference counting operations and function lookups. The compiled programs run within the Python interpreter and use its internal API to implement language semantics. By separately enabling and disabling compiler optimizations, we can thus measure how much each language feature contributes to total execution time in the interpreter.We find that a boxed representation of numbers as heap objects is the single most costly language feature on numeric codes, accounting for up to 43% of total execution time in our benchmark set. On symbolic object-oriented code, late binding of function and method calls costs up to 30%. Redundant reference counting, dynamic type checks, and Python's elaborate function calling convention have comparatively smaller costs.\"), \n",

In this paper, we explore the features available in Python which are useful and efficient for end user analysis in High Energy Physics (HEP). A typical vertical slice of an HEP data analysis is somewhat fragmented: the state of the reduction/analysis process must be saved at certain stages to allow for selective reprocessing of only parts of a generally time-consuming workflow. Also, algorithms tend to to be modular because of the heterogeneous nature of most detectors and the need to analyze different parts of the detector separately before combining the information. This fragmentation causes difficulties for interactive data analysis, and as data sets increase in size and complexity (O10 TiB for a \"small\" neutrino experiment to the O10 PiB currently held by the CMS experiment at the LHC), data analysis methods traditional to the field must evolve to make optimum use of emerging HPC technologies and platforms. Mainstream big data tools, while suggesting a direction in terms of what can be done if an entire data set can be available across a system and analysed with high-level programming abstractions, are not designed with either scientific computing generally, or modern HPC platform features in particular, such as data caching levels, in mind.Our example HPC use case is a search for a new elementary particle which might explain the phenomenon known as \"Dark Matter\".

In this paper, we present a Python predictive analysis. It first collects the trace of an execution, and then encodes the trace and unexecuted branches to symbolic constraints. Symbolic variables are introduced to denote input values, their dynamic types, and attribute sets, to reason about their variations. Solving the constraints identifies bugs and their triggering inputs. Our evaluation shows that the technique is highly effective in analyzing real-world complex programs with a lot of dynamic features and external library calls, due to its sophisticated encoding design based on traces. It identifies 46 bugs from 11 real-world projects, with 16 new bugs. All reported bugs are true positives.'), \n",

Coverage data on these projects is gathered and hosted on the Codecov website, from where this data can be mined. Using this data, and a syntactic parse of the code, we examine the effect of control flow structure, statement type (e.g., if, for) and code age on test coverage. We find that coverage depends on control flow structure, with more deeply nested statements being significantly less likely to be covered. This is a clear effect, which holds up in every project, even when controlling for the age of the line (as determined by git blame). We find that the age of a line per se has a small (but statistically significant) positive effect on coverage. Finally, we find that the kind of statement (try, if, except, raise, etc) has varying effects on coverage, with exception-handling statements being covered much less often. These results suggest that developers in Python projects have difficulty writing test sets that cover deeply-nested and error-handling statements, and might need assistance covering such code.'), \n",

Additionally to the easy programming interface, the large number of libraries and modules that have been made available by a large number of contributors, have taken this language to the top of the list of the most popular programming languages in scientific applications. However, one main drawback of Python is the lack of support for concurrency or parallelism. PyCOMPSs is a proved approach to support task-based parallelism in Python that enables applications to be executed in parallel in distributed computing platforms.This paper presents PyCOMPSs and how it has been tailored to execute tasks in heterogeneous and multi-threaded environments. We present an approach to combine the task-level parallelism provided by PyCOMPSs with the thread-level parallelism provided by MKL. Performance and behavioral results in distributed computing heterogeneous clusters show the benefits and capabilities of PyCOMPSs in both HPC and Big Data infrastructures.'), \n",

In this paper, we present the curriculum design, implementation, and results from a one-trimester introductory Python course that is mandatory for all 8th graders in our school district. This course is a crucial component of the K-12 computational thinking pathways we are developing at our school district, which take students from block-based programming and computational thinking (elementary school) to text-based programming and applications of computer science (high school). Our mandatory 8th grade course serves as a bridge between these two components. We present qualitative results that highlight the challenges that arose from teaching a course for all students -- not just those with a prior interest in computing -- and how the instructor overcame those challenges. We also present quantitative results that demonstrate the course's positive impact on students' attitudes towards computer science, their intent to re-engage with computer science in the future, and the gender gap with regards to confidence in computer science.\"), \n",

Beginning with a simulation code that is instrumented to use the SENSEI in situ interface, we present how to couple it with a Python-based data consumer, which may be run in situ, and in parallel at the same concurrency as the simulation. We present two examples that demonstrate the new capability. One is an analysis of the reaction rate in a proxy simulation of a chemical reaction on a 2D substrate, while the other is a coupling of an AMR simulation to Yt, a parallel visualization and analysis library written in Python.

            "        ('abstract', 'The amount of spatial data acquired from crowdsourced platforms, mobile devices, sensors and cartographic agencies has grown exponentially over the past few years. Nearly half of the spatial data available currently are stored and processed through large relational databases. Due to a lack of generic open source tools, researchers and analysts often have difficulty in extracting and analyzing large amounts of spatial data from traditional databases. In order to overcome this challenge, the most effective way is to perform the analysis directly in the database, which enables quick retrieval and visualization of spatial data stored in relational databases. Also, working in-database reduces the network overhead, as users do not need to replicate the complete data into their local system. While a number of spatial analysis libraries are readily available, they do not work in-database, and typically require additional platform-specific software. Our goal is to bridge this gap by developing a new method through an open source software to perform fast and seamless spatial analysis without having to store the data in-memory. We propose a framework implemented in Python, which embeds geospatial analytics into a spatial database (i.e. IBM DB2 ®). The framework internally translates the spatial functions written by the user into SQL queries, which follow the standards of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and can operate on single as well as multiple geometries. We then demonstrate how to combine the results of spatial operations with visualization methods such as choropleth maps within Jupyter notebooks. Finally, we elaborate upon the benefits of our approach via a real-world use case, in which we analyze crime hotspots in New York City using the in-database spatial functions.'), \n",

From 1,962,535 code snippets tagged with 'python', we extracted 407,097 snippets of at least 6 statements of Python code. Surprisingly, 93.87% of the extracted snippets contain style violations, with an average of 0.7 violations per statement and a huge number of snippets with a considerably higher ratio. Researchers and developers should, therefore, be aware that code snippets on SO may not representative of good coding style.Furthermore, while user reputation seems to be unrelated to coding style compliance, for posts with vote scores in the range between -10 and 20, we found a strong correlation (r = -0.87, p &lt; 10-7) between the vote score a post received and the average number of violations per statement for snippets in such posts.\"), \n",

The approach is based on interpreter-level composition, ultimately making a full-fledged integrated development environment (IDE) part of the language execution process. This allows to directly control interpreters of foreign languages from Smalltalk. It also enables tool reuse and provides the ability to rapidly build new tools.We demonstrate how we have combined Squeak/Smalltalk and PyPy's Python implementation. We then reused Squeak's debugger, so that it enables edit-and-continue style debugging of Python applications---which is currently not supported by Python's PDB or any Python IDE, but which has proven to be invaluable in many debugging scenarios.\"), \n",

We hence propose to use probabilistic inference to allow the beliefs of individual type hints to be propagated, aggregated, and eventually converge on probabilities of variable types.

In this paper, we introduce PyTA, a wrapper for pylint that provides custom checks for common novice errors as well as improved messages to help students fix the errors that are found. We report on our experience integrating PyTA into an existing online system used to deliver programming exercises to CS1 students and evaluate it by comparing exercise submissions collected from the integrated system to previously collected data. This analysis demonstrates that, for students who chose to read the PyTA output, we observed a decrease in time to solve errors, occurrences of repeated errors, and submissions to complete a programming problem. This suggests that PyTA, and static analyses in general, may help students identify functional issues in their code not highlighted by compiler feedback and that static analysis output may help students more quickly identify debug their code.'), \n",

Due to its design nature, Python is relatively slow compared to other languages. It operates through compiling the code into powerful bytecode instructions that are executed by an interpreter. Python's speed is limited due to its interpreter design, and thus there is a significant need to optimize the language. In this paper, we discuss one possible approach and limitations in optimizing Python based on bytecode transformations. In the first stage of the proposed optimizer, the bytecode is expanded using function inline and loop unrolling. The second stage of transformations simplifies the bytecode by applying a complete set of data-flow optimizations, including constant propagation, algebraic simplifications, dead code elimination, copy propagation, common sub expressions elimination, loop invariant code motion and strength reduction. While these optimizations are known and their implementation mechanism (data flow analysis) is well developed, they have not been successfully implemented in Python due to its dynamic features which prevent their use. In this work we attempt to understand the dynamic features of Python and how these features affect and limit the implementation of these optimizations. In particular, we consider the significant effects of first unrolling and then inlining on the ability to apply the remaining optimizations. The results of our experiments indicate that these optimizations can indeed be implemented and dramatically improve execution times.\"), \n",

This limits their application at certain intervals of time, mostly daily, by temporarily keeping the composition of the portfolio static.In this work, we bring together for the first time nested Monte Carlo simulations with the real-time continuous risk measurement of complex portfolios that dynamically change their composition during intraday operation.

In this study, we are classifying the uses of lambda expressions based on varying scenarios. We identified 13 different usages of lambda expressions from these Python repositories. This catalog is an attempt to support programmers to use lambda expressions more effectively and efficiently.\"), \n",

            "        ('abstract', \"We present SysPy (System Python) a tool which exploits the strengths of the popular Python scripting language to boost design productivity of embedded System on Chips for FPGAs. SysPy acts as a “glue” software between mature HDLs, ready-to-use VHDL components and programmable processor soft IP cores. SysPy can be used to: (i) automatically translate hardware components described in Python into synthesizable VHDL, (ii) capture top-level structural descriptions of processor-centric SoCs in Python, (iii) implement all the steps necessary to compile the user's C code for an instruction set processor core and generate processor specific Tcl scripts that import to the design project all the necessary HDL files of the processor's description and instantiate/connect the core to other blocks in a synthesizable top-level Python description. Moreover, we have developed a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) in Python which allows user applications running in a host PC to utilize effortlessly the SoC's resources in the FPGA. SysPy's design capabilities, when complemented with the developed HAL software API, provide all the necessary tools for hw/sw partitioning and iterative design for efficient SoC's performance tuning. We demonstrate how SysPy's design flow and functionalities can be used by building a processor-centric embedded SoC for computational systems biology. The designed SoC, implemented using a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA, combines the flexibility of a programmable soft processor core (Leon3) with the high performance of an application specific core to simulate flexibly and efficiently the stochastic behavior of large size biomolecular reaction networks. Such networks are essential for studying the dynamics of complex biological systems consisting of multiple interacting pathways.\"), \n",

For example the Astr\\\\'{e}e static analyzer soundly overapproximates the behavior of C programs that do not contain any dynamic code loading, longjmp statements nor recursive functions. The sound and precise analysis of widely used dynamic programming languages like JavaScript and Python remains a challenge. This paper examines the variation of static analyses of Python – in precision, time and memory usage – by adapting three parameters: the value sensitivity, the allocation sensitivity and the activation of an abstract garbage collector . It is not clear yet which level of sensitivity constitutes a sweet spot in terms of precision versus efficiency to achieve a meaningful Python analysis. We thus perform an experimental evaluation using a prototype static analyzer on benchmarks a few thousand lines long. Key findings are: the value analysis does not improve the precision over type-related alarms; the value analysis is three times costlier than the type analysis; the allocation sensitivity depends on the value sensitivity; using an abstract garbage collector lowers memory usage and running times, but does not affect precision.\"), \n",
