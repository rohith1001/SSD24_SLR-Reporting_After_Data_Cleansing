## SSD24_SLR-Reporting_After_Data_Cleansing
### Understanding the Project:
* This project pertains to data visualization. Data filtered in the previous phases of this
project needs to be presented graphically using statistical graphs, plots, pie charts etc.
This visualization provides a more intuitive understanding.
* The project may involve use of python libraries such as matplotlib, pandas, seaborn etc.
### Approach:
* From the selected papers we would first apply one hot encoding to calculate the frequency of
words and based on that we would be able to plot various diagrams based on the trending
topics, most valuable conferences according to people, classification based on the streams,
universities, citations, number of authors and many more.
### Relevant Study material:
We would be focusing on the standard data science blogs like ​ towardsdatascience.io​ and
open source courses of IBM and other other recognized universities and moreover we would be
referring standard documentations of libraries that would be used and for python we have
already become quite aware with the syntax due to our labs and for other functionalities we
would refer certain documentations available online.
### Milestones:
* Data cleaning:​ We don’t really know if the shortlisted papers we would get are
according to the required format or not so we would have to first put them into a proper
format for the purpose of data extractions so that we could run a text extraction algorithm
on the papers in order to extract relevant data.
* After this we would need to categorize our data points(papers) according to the different
keywords extracted. For example, if we have a point for the conference from which the
particular paper is from we would be able to segregate the papers on the basis of the
conference an then analyse and draw inferences like which conference is the most
valuable one or which conference do people prefer to publish in for a preferred stream of
topics etc.
* Creating UI: ​ This would be the last step. We would need to create a UI(website) or
jupyter notebook that would be able to present our analysis to other people. We are
planning to build a dashboard kind of thing for this purpose and hosting it on
web.iiit.ac.in in order for it to be accessible across to all the people of university.
